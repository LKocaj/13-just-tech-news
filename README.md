# Just Tech News 

In this module, you’ll build the back end for your first completely full-stack application, Just Tech News—a tech news website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. You’ll use Sequelize, an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, to simplify your MySQL queries, add password hashing so that users can create secure passwords, and connect your application to JawsDB, a MySQL add-on for Heroku.
